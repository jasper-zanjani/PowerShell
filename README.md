This repo contains an assortment of PowerShell scripts.

Refer to the [wiki](wiki) for my notes on PowerShell syntax and scripting.

PowerShell commands to automate the application of Internet Explorer browser security settings, for case workers who need to browse the **Florida Safe Families Network (FSFN)**, a web-based computer system run by the [Florida Department of Children and Families](https://www.myflfamilies.com/).

This script makes prominent use of the `Set-ItemProperty` cmdlet
