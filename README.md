This repo contains an assortment of PowerShell scripts.

Refer to the [wiki](wiki) for my notes on PowerShell syntax and scripting.

PowerShell commands to automate the application of Internet Explorer browser security settings, for case workers who need to browse the **Florida Safe Families Network (FSFN)**, a web-based computer system run by the [Florida Department of Children and Families](https://www.myflfamilies.com/).
FSFN is an ancient system that requires users to run the obsolete Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser - with these ActiveX settings applied.

#### Î [Get-Sign](Get-Sign.ps1)
A demonstration PowerShell module and cmdlet that will return the astrological sign of a person born on a given date.
